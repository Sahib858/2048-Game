# Project Overview
The goal of this project is for me to learn the basics of **Object Oriented Programming** and some **Java** syntax.
This code is relatively elementary and not at its best performance. The idea was to build something basic utilizing various java libraries to get a good feel for concepts. Basic manipulation of array data structures, reading java documentation and working on a project for a majority of the quarter.

This program is designed to act exactly the same as the famous **game 2048**. 
It basically gives you a board and let you move around tiles with values that have the powers of 2 on it.
When two adjacent tiles with the same value move in the given direction, the tiles would combine and merge into one tile. 
You will earn score every time you merge two tiles.

# How to play 
  Build the project with IDE such as **Visual Studio** and run **Gui2048.java** to play with the game with graphic user interface like the app version on desktop.
  Alternatively, You can also run **Game2048.java** and play the game on the command line (with instructions provided).
